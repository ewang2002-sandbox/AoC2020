# Advent Of Code 2020
My solutions to the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) questions.

## Language of Choice
- C# (.NET Core 3.1)

## Layout 
For each question, I will do the following. 

#### Stage 1: *Make It Work...*
I will try to do the question as fast as possible using what I know. In other words, I do not spend much time optimizing. 

These solutions can be found in the `AoC2020/Solutions` directory.

#### Stage 2: *...Then Make It Better.*
After I successfully submit a question, I will go back to my original solution and see what I could do to make it "better." 

In the case that I need to revise my code, I will put the revised solution in the `AoC2020/Revised` directory.
